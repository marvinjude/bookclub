## Ways to Improve this assesment

- The assesment looks pretty neat, however we can go a step further by asking candidates to implement some sort of micro intraction on the page, this may help test how creative they are when it comes to crafting solid user expereinces.

# Others Details

## Data separation over hardcoding

Ideally, applications usually have data layers - APIs, this application is modeled close to that. Only that the data in sitted in the application itself.

## Componentization

I'm a huge fan of components especially because they are easy to reason about when building apps. This application does some form of componentization.. Somtething like a React component. I wrote components like `Book`, `FeaturedBook` ...

Here's an example of one of them - `StarRating.js`

```
/**
 * @param {number} rating - The star rating - e.g StarRating(4), StarRating(5)
 * @returns {string}  A template based on the number of rating  passed
 */

function StarRating(rating) {
  const getStar = (filled) => `
      <svg width="13" height="11" viewBox="0 0 13 11" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
        <path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M6.41391 0L8.28908 3.62102L12.4526 4.19917L9.43325 7.01383L10.1484 11L6.41391 9.12863L2.67947 11L3.39458 7.01383L0.375244 4.19917L4.55464 3.62102L6.41391 0Z" fill=${
          filled ? "#EBA430" : "#DDDDDD"
        }><path>
      </svg>`;

  let template = "";

  //Add Filled stars
  for (let i = 0; i < rating; i++) {
    template = template + getStar(true);
  }

  //Add Unfilled stars
  for (let i = 0; i < 5 - rating; i++) {
    template = template + getStar(false);
  }

  return template;
}

export default StarRating;
```
